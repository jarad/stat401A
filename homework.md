The homework problems below are from the 3rd edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1133490670/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1133490670&linkCode=as2&tag=jarnieassprod-20">The Statistical Sleuth: A Course in Methods of Data Analysis</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jarnieassprod-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1133490670" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
. 
The homework problems in this textbook are split into three sections: Conceptual Exercises, Computational Exercises, and Data Problems. As the name suggests, the Conceptual Exercises are available to test your understanding of the concepts introduced in the chapter.
The answers to these problems can be found immediately following the Data Problems. The Computational Exercises are typically short answer problems aimed at testing your ability to calculate quantities introduced in the chapter, e.g. point estimates, pvalues, and confidence intervals. 
The Data Problems focus on understanding what these quantities mean in the context of a specific problem. 
These problems typically require a more extensive answer, e.g. "a brief statistical report". 
Solutions for many odd numbered problems in the Computational Exercises and Data Problems sections can be found in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1133491332/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1133491332&linkCode=as2&tag=jarnieassprod-20">Student Solutions Manual</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jarnieassprod-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1133491332" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. 


### Grading of homework

Each homework will be graded in two parts. Half (rounded down) of the problems on each homework will be graded for attempt while the remaining problems will be graded for accuracy. The grading scales for attempt and accuracy are given below:

- Attempt: these problems will be graded on a 3 point scale for effort only
  - 0 points: problem was not attempted
  - 1 point : problem was attempted but clearly not enough work was done
  - 2 points: enough work was done to have solved the problem
- Accuracy: these problems will be graded for accuracy on a scale from 0 to 2 depending on how accurate the solution is

Each homework will get equal weight toward the overall homework grade for the course.

### Assigned homework (always due at 8am in class):

The code below is CC.PPzz where 

- CC refers to the chapter
- PP refers to the problem number
- zz refers to the subparts of the problem (if there is no zz, then do all parts of the problem).

For example 9.7a-c refers to chapter 9, problem 7, parts a through c. The datasets for all problems can be found [here](http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/~schafer/Sleuth/files/sleuth3csv.zip).
